# Theme Tokens

The application theme uses shared design tokens for colors, fonts, and spacing.

## Colors
- **Primary:** Blue 600 (`#2563EB`)
- **Secondary:** Green 600 (`#059669`)

## Fonts
- **Body:** Inter
- **Headings:** Poppins

## Spacing Scale
| Token | Value (px) |
|-------|-----------|
| xxs   | 4 |
| xs    | 8 |
| sm    | 12 |
| md    | 16 |
| lg    | 24 |
| xl    | 32 |
| xxl   | 40 |
| xxxl  | 48 |

These tokens are consumed by `AppTheme` and widgets such as `AppButton` to ensure
consistent styling across the app.
